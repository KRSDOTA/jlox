 I have an interesting issue with the following:


 "1000" + 30 = 10030.0

 and 

 "30" + 1000 = 30.01000

 There's basically a bunch of weird and undefined behaviour with adding mixed types.

 First port of call should be to:

 1) If you have a string and a number, try and parse the string.
 2)  If the String can't be parsed as a Double, then default to string concetenation

 This should fix the addition operation for a double and a string back to being an associative operation:

 "1000" + 30 = 1030.0 

 and 

 30 + "1000" = 1030.0
